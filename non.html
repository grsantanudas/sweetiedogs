        Chocolate had gone. She had taken huge chunk of my heart with her. Now there only remained Nonsense, the embodiment of happiness, love, peskiness and mischief. She would run around the complex twenty-four hours a day. She was cute, with large, adorable eyes and floppy ears like her Labrador-resembling father. Her mother simply adored her. But another dark cloud overshadowed the dogs. Soon, Nonsense was infected by Parbo-virus, the lethal disease which had robbed Chocolate of her jubilant life. Luckily, everyone was aware and on the alert this time. Nonsense was given injections and medication. But she would not eat. I tempted her with large Good Day biscuits, but she ignored them. Bimal Uncle mixed biscuit crumbs with water and filled up a syringe with this curious liquid. He inserted the syringe between the teeth of a reluctant Nonsense, who had been quietly sunning herself. She sucked in the mixture of water and biscuit. A few days later, I went to visit Nonsense. She was playing in front of the office with her mother. Nonsense looked as happy and springy as ever. She had a new red collar around her neck. She darted over to meet me. She was cured. I regretted how nobody realised Chocolate’s illness. Now Nonsense was cured, she would start licking everybody and pirouetting around again.

        Nonsense is in her canine preadolescence now. Her floppy ears have perked up. She constantly troubles Sweetie for food. She goes and pokes her mother and pushes her. In the afternoon, she lazily lies in the office. I often go and pet her. Then she bares her teeth, lifts her leg and widens her eyes. It is her way of expressing happiness. She, along with her old father, fat mother and skinny stepsister, guard the complex at night. They bark, yowl, howl and wail. Socrates makes his special whines. Sweetiepie has a special way of howling. She howls at the moon, like the foxes. She must have learned it from her vulpine cousins (I am speaking scientifically. The dogs chase the foxes around all the time).  Just last night, Sweetie was seen giving howling classes to Nonsense. She was showing to which direction Nonsense must point her nose at. I don’t know why Sweetie admires vulpine howling.
